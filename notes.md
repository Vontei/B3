Routes:

_this whole area can be condensed using ajax.  multiple drop downs
could allow users to navigate from state to range, then render.

  /locations
  looking at a list of states..click on state


  /locations/loc:id  
  looking at a list of ranges, click a range


  /locations/loc:id/range:id
  looking at a list of observations, click an ob


  /locations/loc:id/range:id/obsid  
  looking at an observation and its comments


  /locations/loc:id/range:id/observations/obs:id




  maybe make an incidents index..where checking an avalanche seen box on the ob
  pushes it to an array that is displayed for everyone.

  -this way you can see most recent high danger areas on the home page before searching


  -avalanche news feed on home page
  SO. top incidents index
  bottom related news stream?
